  "notes": "Meta-session: building the tracking system itself. Scores are rough manual estimates since the framework didn't exist during execution. Divergence is moderate because we're building on prior art (Reflexive Forge seed). Safety is high because governance was central to design. Heat is high because framework is complete and usable. Forge is moderate because real-world testing is needed. Clarity is good but could improve by simplifying recursion policies in future iterations."
