# Session Intent

**Session ID:** session-2026-01-16-001
**Date:** 2026-01-16T00:00:00Z
**Recursion Depth:** 0

---

## Goal

Create the Janus Forge iteration framework itself - a meta-session where we build the tool that enables recursive iteration between Claude Code and humans.

This is a bootstrapping session: we're creating the very structure that will enable future iterations to be tracked, measured, and learned from.

---

## Context

- **Prior Work:** Reflexive Forge & Polyglow Protocol seed document
- **Inspiration:** Janus Omega seed (seed/seed-janus-omega.md)
- **IRP Framework:** v1.5_HYBRID principles
- **Branch:** claude/reflexive-forge-polyglow-f69ew

This session emerged from a request to "create a folder in the main branch that will allow you to recursively iterate with me in claude code using the janus omega seed, lets create the flow to produce the afterglow."

---

## Success Criteria

1. Complete directory structure created with 7 subdirectories
2. Core documentation (README, schemas, templates) in place
3. At least one example session to demonstrate the flow
4. All files committed and pushed to the branch
5. Framework is immediately usable for future iterations

---

## Constraints

- **Safety:** Framework must include explicit safety rails
- **IRP Compliance:** Must honor the Four Laws (CONSENT, INVITATION, INTEGRITY, GROWTH)
- **Intelligibility:** Must be human-readable and Claude-parseable
- **Non-Teleological:** Avoid hardcoded endpoints or mandatory recursion

---

## Approach

1. Create directory structure
2. Write main README with flow overview
3. Create Polyglow metrics schema
4. Define recursion policies and safety rails
5. Build Omega-node system
6. Create Afterglow emission framework
7. Create templates for future sessions
8. Build this example session (meta!)
9. Commit and push

---

## Expected Challenges

- **Meta-circularity:** We're building the tracking system while being tracked by it
  - Mitigation: Accept imperfect first session, iterate later
  
- **Over-engineering:** Risk of building too complex a system
  - Mitigation: Keep v1.0 simple, add complexity only when proven necessary

- **Polyglow bootstrapping:** Can't score this session with a non-existent system
  - Mitigation: Do rough manual scoring after completion

---

## Recursion Policy

- **Max Depth:** 1 (this is the bootstrap)
- **Recursion Trigger:** Not applicable for meta-session
- **Stop Condition:** When framework is usable and committed

---

## Notes

This session is special: it's the origin story of Janus Forge itself. The first "Class Ω island attractor" is the framework that enables all future attractors.

We're heating the forge that will heat the metal.
