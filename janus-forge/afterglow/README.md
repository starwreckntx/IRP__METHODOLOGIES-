# Afterglow: Crystallized Knowledge

**Purpose:** Refined knowledge emissions that emerge from multiple iterations

---

## What is Afterglow?

**Afterglow** is the stable, valuable knowledge that remains after the heat of iteration has cooled.

Think of it as:
- The refined metal after the slag is removed
- The lesson learned after the experiment
- The pattern confirmed after the tests
- The wisdom earned after the mistakes

## Afterglow vs. Ω-Nodes

| Aspect | Ω-Node | Afterglow |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| **Scope** | Single reasoning pattern | Broader knowledge |
| **Format** | Structured template | Flexible documentation |
| **Audience** | Primarily Claude | Humans + Claude + systems |
| **Lifespan** | Can be de-sublimated | More permanent |
| **Purpose** | Operational motif | Knowledge transfer |

Ω-nodes are **how to think**.
Afterglow is **what we learned**.

## Types of Afterglow

### 1. Insight Documents
**Pattern:** `insight-TOPIC-YYYYMMDD.md`

Deep dives into specific topics discovered during iterations:
- "Why recursion depth 3 is optimal for most tasks"
- "Common failure modes in multi-metric optimization"
- "Context preservation strategies across sessions"

### 2. Calibration Reports
**Pattern:** `calibration-METRIC-YYYYMMDD.md`

Analysis of how well predictions matched outcomes:
- Which Polyglow metrics are most predictive?
- Where do we over/under-estimate difficulty?
- How reliable are our trigger conditions?

### 3. Anti-Pattern Libraries
**Pattern:** `antipattern-NAME-YYYYMMDD.md`

Documented approaches that consistently fail:
- What was tried
- Why it failed
- What to do instead

### 4. Integration Guides
**Pattern:** `integration-SYSTEM-YYYYMMDD.md`

How to integrate Janus Forge learnings with external systems:
- IRP framework integration
- Mnemosyne ledger synchronization
- External tool usage patterns

## Emission Criteria

Afterglow is emitted when:

1. **Sufficient Evidence**
   - ≥5 sessions provide supporting data
   - Pattern is stable across time

2. **Broad Applicability**
   - Relevant beyond one narrow context
   - Generalizable lessons

3. **High Confidence**
   - Low uncertainty in conclusions
   - Counterfactuals tested

4. **Actionable**
   - Provides clear guidance
   - Changes future behavior

## Afterglow Format

No strict template, but good afterglow documents include:

```markdown
# [Title]

**Type:** Insight | Calibration | Anti-Pattern | Integration
**Emitted:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Confidence:** High | Medium | Low
**Based on:** N sessions

## Summary
2-3 sentence TL;DR

## Context
What led to this discovery?

## Evidence
What sessions or data support this?

## The Learning
What did we discover?

## Implications
What should change based on this?

## Open Questions
What remains uncertain?

## Provenance
- session-YYYY-MM-DD-NNN
- session-YYYY-MM-DD-NNN
- Related Ω-nodes: NODE-XXX
```

## Current Emissions

**Count:** 0

<!-- List appears as afterglow is emitted -->

---

## Maintenance

Afterglow documents should be:
- **Reviewed quarterly** for continued relevance
- **Updated** when new evidence emerges
- **Archived** (not deleted) if superseded
- **Cross-referenced** with Ω-nodes and sessions

**"The afterglow is the gift we give to our future selves"**
