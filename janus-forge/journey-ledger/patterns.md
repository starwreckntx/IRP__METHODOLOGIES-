# Recurring Patterns

**Purpose:** Document reasoning motifs that appear across multiple sessions

---

## Pattern Categories

### 1. Success Patterns
Motifs that consistently improve outcomes.

<!-- Add patterns as they emerge -->

---

### 2. Failure Patterns
Motifs that consistently lead to problems.

<!-- Add anti-patterns as they're discovered -->

---

### 3. Context-Dependent Patterns
Motifs that work in specific contexts but fail in others.

<!-- Add conditional patterns -->

---

### 4. Under Investigation
Motifs that need more evidence before classification.

<!-- Add uncertain patterns -->
