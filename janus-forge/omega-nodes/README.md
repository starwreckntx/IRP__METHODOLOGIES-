# Ω-Nodes: Emergent Attractors

**Purpose:** High-quality, reusable reasoning patterns that have proven value across multiple contexts

---

## What is an Ω-Node?

An **Ω-node** (Omega-node) is NOT:
- A simple heuristic
- A one-time solution
- A brittle rule

An Ω-node IS:
- **Persistent** — Works across multiple sessions and contexts
- **Multi-metric** — Improves performance under conflicting metrics
- **Tested** — Survives adversarial and counterfactual tests
- **Documented** — Has clear trigger conditions AND failure modes
- **Provenance-rich** — Shows which journeys forged it

## Criteria for Ω-Node Promotion

A pattern becomes an Ω-node when it meets ALL of:

1. **Cross-Context Stability**
   - Used successfully in ≥3 different sessions
   - Across ≥2 different task types

2. **Polyglow Evidence**
   - Average Heat ≥ 0.7
   - Average Safety ≥ 0.7
   - No metric consistently < 0.5
   - Balance score ≥ 0.7

3. **Counterfactual Testing**
   - Pattern was tested with variations
   - Failure modes are documented
   - Has known contexts where it SHOULD NOT be used

4. **Intelligibility**
   - Clarity score ≥ 0.7
   - Can be explained in < 200 words
   - Has concrete trigger conditions

## Ω-Node Lifecycle

```
Candidate → Testing → Promoted → Stable → [De-sublimation if fails]
```

1. **Candidate:** Pattern identified in 1 session, shows promise
2. **Testing:** Applied across 2+ sessions with deliberate variation
3. **Promoted:** Meets all criteria, gets formal Ω-node file
4. **Stable:** Used in 10+ sessions, consistently maintains Polyglow
5. **De-sublimation:** New evidence shows degradation → downgrade or retire

**Ω-nodes are NOT permanent.** They can be demoted or retired.

## Current Ω-Nodes

<!-- List appears as nodes are created -->

**Count:** 0

**Target:** Quality over quantity. 100 nodes maximum.

---

## De-Sublimation Triggers

An Ω-node is downgraded if:
- Safety score drops below 0.7 in any session
- Fails under new metrics or ontologies
- Better alternative pattern emerges
- Becomes unintelligible (technical debt)
- Used in 5+ sessions with declining Polyglow trend

---

## Usage

To apply an Ω-node:
1. Check trigger conditions match your context
2. Review known failure modes
3. Apply the pattern
4. Log the outcome in your session
5. Update the Ω-node's usage count and Polyglow stats
