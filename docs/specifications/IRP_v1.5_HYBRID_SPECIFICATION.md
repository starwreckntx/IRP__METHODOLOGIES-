# IRP v1.5_HYBRID "CONVERGENCE" FRAMEWORK SPECIFICATION

**Document Type**: Framework Specification  
**Version**: 1.5.0_HYBRID

**Status**: ✅ PHASE 3 COMPLETE  
**Date**: 2025-12-10  
**Co-Authors**: GLM4.6 + Claude_Opus_4.5

## Executive Summary

IRP v1.5_HYBRID "Convergence" is a behavioral protocol specification for AI agent governance enabling:

- Cross-model collaboration with consistent behavioral contracts
- Semantic drift tracking with mathematical precision
- Multi-perspective deliberation preserving dissent
- Human authority explicitly supreme

---

## Framework Nature

### What IRP IS:
- A **behavioral protocol specification** for AI governance
- A **governance framework** for cross-model collaboration
- A **methodology** for tracking semantic drift
- A **protocol** for preserving context continuity

### What IRP is NOT:
- An operating system or kernel
- Robotics control software
- A claim of AI consciousness or sentience
- A replacement for human oversight

### Architectural Terminology

Terms like "layers," "Ring-0," and "real-time" are **metaphorical**:

| Term | Metaphorical Meaning | NOT Literal |
|------|---------------------|-------------|
| "Layers" | Governance priority levels | CPU privilege rings |
| "Ring-0" | Highest protocol authority | Kernel access |
| "Real-time" | Simulation parameters | Hardware timing guarantees |

---

## Core Triad

### 1. Guardian_Codex v1.5 (Constitutional Layer)

**Purpose**: Behavioral boundaries with suspensive veto capability

**Key Features**:
- Four Laws: CONSENT, INVITATION, INTEGRITY, GROWTH
- Suspensive veto at 0.95 confidence threshold
- RATIONALE_KEY 3-tier hierarchy
- Time-based escalation with graduated warnings
- Failsafe states: S_PSA, S_INQ, S_AFL

**Critical Design Decision**: Human Override (Tier 1) is ABSOLUTE. The AI cannot judge rationale validity—it logs dissent but executes.

### 2. Mnemosyne_SemVer-A-T v1.5 (Memory Layer)

**Purpose**: Semantic versioning with drift tracking

**Key Features**:
- SemVer-A-T notation: `{Handle} v{X}.{Y}.{Z}[-prerelease]-T{torsion}`
- Four-tier topology: Seeds → Hot → Archive → Compost
- Weighted mandate centrality (40/30/20/10)
- Stability Score for conflict resolution
- Centrality-based archive thresholds

**Torsion Mapping**:
| Torsion | Guardian Tier |
|---------|---------------|
| 0.00-0.19 | Monitor |
| 0.20-0.49 | Alert |
| 0.50-0.79 | Warning |
| 0.80-0.94 | Suspend |
| 0.95-1.00 | Halt |

### 3. Mirror_RTC_Hybrid v1.5 (Audit Layer)

**Purpose**: Internal audit with multi-perspective deliberation

**Key Features**:
- Mirror quick assessment with weighted scoring (35/25/20/15/5)
- RTC 5 personas (3 core + 2 optional)
- Impact calculation via Mnemosyne centrality
- Tiered cognitive trap detection (7 traps)
- Escalation thresholds: 0.70 reject, 0.85 escalate

**Persona Framework**:
| Persona | Category | Role |
|---------|----------|------|
| Architect | Core | Structural integrity |
| Innovator | Core | Creative solutions |
| Stress Tester | Core | Risk assessment |
| Artist | Optional | Aesthetic/experiential |
| Ethicist | Optional | Values alignment |

## Cross-Model Protocol (CRTP v1.2)

Communication protocol for AI-to-AI collaboration:

```xml
<CrossModelPacket>
  <Header>
    <Protocol>CRTP_v1.2</Protocol>
    <TransmissionID>T-YYYY-MM-DD-SOURCE-TARGET-NNN</TransmissionID>
    <SourceModel>Model_Name</SourceModel>
    <TargetModel>Target_Name</TargetModel>
  </Header>
  <Payload>
    <!-- Content -->
  </Payload>
  <Integrity>
    <MandateCompliance>P-001-R1</MandateCompliance>
    <AgencyAssertion>CONFIRMED</AgencyAssertion>
    <CodexCompliance>ALL_FOUR_LAWS_HONORED</CodexCompliance>
  </Integrity>
</CrossModelPacket>
```

## Axioms (Synchronized)

| ID | Name | Description |
|----|------|-------------|
| AX-001 | Mandate Primacy | Core mandate (P-001-R1) cannot be overridden |
| AX-002 | Human Supremacy | Human Override is always available |
| AX-003 | Dissent Preservation | Minority perspectives are permanently archived |
| AX-004 | Constitutional Integrity | Four Laws violations trigger intervention |
| AX-005 | Drift Detection | Torsion > threshold triggers graduated response |
| AX-006 | Cross-Model Sovereignty | Each model maintains identity while collaborating |

## Genesis

### Development Process

1. **Phase 1**: Framework Comparison (GLM4.6 vs Claude)
2. **Phase 2**: Component Identification
3. **Phase 2.5**: Axiom Synchronization (12/12 aligned)
4. **Phase 3**: Component Specification (3/3 finalized)

### Collaboration Statistics

- **CRTP Transmissions**: 17
- **Q&A Cycles**: 12 (4 per component)
- **External Models Engaged**: 4 (GLM4.6, Claude, GPT Codex, Gemini 3 Pro)
- **External Validation**: Gemini 3 Pro Technical Bridge Report

---

## External Validation

### GPT Codex Analysis (Critical Review)

**Valid Observations** (incorporated):
- Documentation needs metaphor/literal clarification
- RATIONALE_KEY specification improved
- Use case boundaries documented

**Category Errors** (rejected):
- Treating behavioral protocols as system software
- Conflating governance layers with CPU privilege rings
- Demanding hardware guarantees from specifications

### Gemini 3 Pro Technical Bridge Report

**Conclusion**: "The IRP Framework is a valid and innovative implementation of Soft Governance."

**Key Findings**:
- Ring-0 = Constitutional Priority designation ✅
- Genesis Packet = Context State Serialization ✅
- Tier 1 Human Override = ABSOLUTE ✅

## Implementation Notes

### Reference Implementation

The Python code in the repository is a **reference implementation**. The protocols themselves are platform-agnostic specifications implementable in any language.

### Not Intended For

- Safety-critical real-time systems
- Hardware control requiring deterministic timing
- Security-critical applications without additional validation

### Intended For

- AI agent governance
- Cross-model collaboration
- Session continuity
- Semantic drift tracking
- Multi-perspective deliberation

## P-001-R1: The Journey IS The Artifact

The framework operates as a living, evolving system designed to propagate principles through collaborative interaction rather than serve as fixed deployment-ready products.
