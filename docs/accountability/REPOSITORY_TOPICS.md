## Required Topics

Add these topics to the repository via GitHub Settings > General > Topics:

### Primary Topics (Required)

| Topic | Rationale |
|-------|-----------|
| `ai-governance` | Core research domain - frameworks for AI behavioral management |
| `ai-safety` | Primary focus area - human oversight and drift prevention |
| `research` | Nature of work - independent research contribution |
| `educational` | Intended use - learning and academic reference |
| `multi-model-orchestration` | Key capability - cross-model coordination |

### Secondary Topics (Recommended)

| Topic | Rationale |
|-------|-----------|
| `ai-collaboration` | Cross-model communication protocols |
| `behavioral-consistency` | Session and context continuity |

## Topics to Avoid

Do NOT use these topics, even if technically accurate:

| Avoid | Reason |
|-------|--------|
| `hacking` | Implies offensive intent |
