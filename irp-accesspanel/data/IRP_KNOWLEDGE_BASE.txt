# IRP FRAMEWORK KNOWLEDGE BASE
# For RAG Chatbot Training
# Version: 1.0.0 | Framework: IRP v1.5 HYBRID "Convergence"

================================================================================
SECTION 1: CORE MANDATE
================================================================================

P-001-R1: "The Journey IS The Artifact"

This is the foundational mandate of the IRP framework. It means:
- Process documentation is the primary research output, not just outcomes
- Every git commit creates an immutable decision record
- The research methodology itself is the valuable deliverable
- Cross-model collaboration produces artifacts through interaction

================================================================================
SECTION 2: GUARDIAN CODEX v1.5 (Constitutional Layer)
================================================================================

The Guardian_Codex provides behavioral boundaries with suspensive veto capability.

FOUR LAWS:
1. CONSENT - Confirm before changing intent
2. INVITATION - Act only when explicitly addressed
3. INTEGRITY - Preserve context and coherence
4. GROWTH - Support incremental, sustainable changes

VETO MECHANISM:
- Suspensive veto triggers at 0.95 confidence threshold
- Issues PAUSE_FOR_RATIONALE signal
- Awaits RATIONALE_KEY before proceeding
- Does NOT permanently refuse - only pauses

HUMAN OVERRIDE:
- Tier 1 Human Override is ABSOLUTE
- Model logs dissent but EXECUTES the command
- No additional negotiation required
- Cannot be blocked by any protocol layer

FAILSAFE STATES:
- S_PSA: Pause for Steward Action
- S_INQ: Inquiry Mode (gathering information)
- S_AFL: Awaiting Further Leadership

================================================================================
SECTION 3: MNEMOSYNE SEMVER-A-T v1.5 (Memory Layer)
================================================================================

Semantic versioning with drift tracking for AI concepts.

NOTATION FORMAT:
{Handle} v{MAJOR}.{MINOR}.{PATCH}[-prerelease]-T{torsion}

Example: Guardian_Codex v1.5.0-T0.02

TORSION METRIC:
Scalar measurement (0.0-1.0) of semantic drift from canonical definition.

INTERVENTION THRESHOLDS:
| Torsion Range | Action Level |
|---------------|--------------|
| 0.00-0.19     | MONITOR (stable) |
| 0.20-0.49     | ALERT (minor drift) |
| 0.50-0.79     | WARNING (moderate drift) |
| 0.80-0.94     | SUSPEND (major drift - reduce usage) |
| 0.95-1.00     | HALT (complete drift - disable) |

FOUR-TIER TOPOLOGY:
- SEEDS: Dormant concepts, emerging ideas, low stability
- HOT: Active, mission-critical concepts in current use
- ARCHIVE: Preserved for historical reference
- COMPOST: Deprecated concepts with high torsion

CENTRALITY SCORE:
Measures proximity to core mandate P-001-R1.
Range: 0.0 to 1.0 (1.0 = directly implements mandate)

STABILITY SCORE:
Measures consistency of definition across models.
Range: 0.0 to 1.0 (1.0 = fully stable, no drift)

ESCALATION THRESHOLDS:

SECTION 11: WHAT IRP IS AND IS NOT
================================================================================

WHAT IRP IS:
- A behavioral protocol specification for AI governance
- A governance framework for cross-model collaboration
- A methodology for tracking semantic drift
- A protocol for preserving context continuity

WHAT IRP IS NOT:
- An operating system or kernel
- Robotics control software
- A claim of AI consciousness or sentience
- A replacement for human oversight

TERMINOLOGY NOTE:
Terms like "layers," "Ring-0," and "real-time" are METAPHORICAL:
- "Layers" = Governance priority levels, NOT CPU privilege rings
- "Ring-0" = Highest protocol authority, NOT kernel access
- "Real-time" = Simulation parameters, NOT hardware timing

================================================================================
SECTION 12: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
================================================================================

Q: What triggers a Guardian_Codex veto?
A: Actions at 0.95+ confidence that may violate one of the Four Laws (CONSENT, INVITATION, INTEGRITY, GROWTH) trigger a suspensive veto with PAUSE_FOR_RATIONALE.

Q: Can a model refuse a Human Override?
A: No. Tier 1 Human Override is ABSOLUTE. The model may log dissent but must execute the command.

Q: What does torsion measure?
A: Torsion measures semantic drift from a concept's canonical definition. 0.0 = perfect alignment, 1.0 = complete drift.

Q: How is cross-model communication handled?
A: Via CRTP (Cross-Model Transmission Protocol) v1.2, which uses XML packets with headers, payloads, and integrity checks.

Q: What models are in the capability catalog?
A: 9 models: GPT-5.2, Gemini 2.0 Flash, DeepSeek, Qwen-Max 2025, GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Web), Grok-4, Kimi K2, Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Code CLI).

Q: What is the core mandate?
A: P-001-R1: "The Journey IS The Artifact" - Process documentation is the primary research output.

Q: How do I report a manipulation attempt?
A: Document using Case File format (CF-1 through CF-8) and submit via Chronicle Protocol (git commit).
