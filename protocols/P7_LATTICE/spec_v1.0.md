## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The LATTICE Protocol provides a multidimensional spatial representation of the 6-Model Committee's knowledge state. It maps semantic tokens into a geometric manifold to identify areas of consensus, divergence, and potential hallucination.

## 2. CORE OBJECTIVES

- **Geometric Alignment**: Position committee members on a semantic grid based on their responses.
- **Consensus Sinks**: Identify regions where multiple models converge on high-fidelity solutions.
- **Divergence Voids**: Flag areas where models significantly deviate from one another, triggering a MUON audit.

## 3. TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### 3.1 The Manifold (L-Manifold)
Concepts are mapped using N-dimensional vectors where distance ($d$) represents semantic divergence.

### 3.2 Spatial Metrics
- **Centrality ($C$)**: The geometric center of the committee's consensus.
- **Dispersion ($\sigma$)**: The variance in model positioning.
