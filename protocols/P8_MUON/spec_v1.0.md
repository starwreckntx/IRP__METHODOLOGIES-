## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The MUON Protocol serves as the high-frequency diagnostic layer for active committee sessions. It monitors the "Lucid Interval" to ensure that multi-model collaboration maintains technical and ethical fidelity.

## 2. CORE OBJECTIVES

- **Heartbeat Monitoring**: Real-time evaluation of session quality.
- **Fidelity Thresholds**: Enforce a minimum 0.85 fidelity score for operational tasks.
- **RTC Escalation**: Automatically trigger a Recursive Thought Committee audit if fidelity drops below the critical threshold.

## 3. MUON METRICS

- **$M_{fidelity}$**: A rolling average of cross-model alignment.
- **$M_{decay}$**: The rate at which semantic context is lost over a conversation thread.
