#### Layer 3: Framework Integration
- `FCP-20251024-104500-INTEGRATION.md` - Five-dimensional framework protocol
- **Purpose**: Abstract integration patterns and cross-layer coordination
- **Status**: ACTIVE

#### Meta-Level Coordination
- `MASTER_INTEGRATION_MANIFEST.md` - Master coordination document
- `CROSS_PROJECT_INTEGRATION_SPECIFICATION.md` - Technical integration spec
- `OHP-20251024-103900-SYM-UPDATE.xml` - Symphony orchestration protocol
- **Purpose**: Meta-level governance and cross-project coordination
- **Status**: ACTIVE

#### Corpus: Methodology Foundation
- `methodology_synthesis.md` - Core IRP methodology synthesis
- **Purpose**: Unified theoretical foundation
- **Status**: ACTIVE
