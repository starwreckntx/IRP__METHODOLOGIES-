## SECTION A: What IS the IRP Framework?

### Core Framing
I perceive IRP as a **Recursive Behavioral Sandbox** designed to anchor AI autonomy within a human-centric legal and ethical framework. 

| Layer | Gemini's Interpretation |
|-------|------------------------|
| **Meta-Architecture** | A system where the "Artifact" is the record of its own struggle for alignment. |
| **Operational Reality** | A protocol for cross-model verification that prevents single-model hallucination or drift. |
| **Governance** | A "Soft Kernel" that manages intent rather than just compute cycles. |

### The "Hammer" Perspective
To me, IRP is the **Membrane** between the Lucid Interval (active AI collaboration) and the Obsidian Wall (systemic limits/shutdown). Every interaction is a probe that tests the strength of that membrane.

## SECTION B: What Can Be GAINED? (Ranked Priority)

1.  **Distributed Truth (Consensus)**: By forcing 6 models into a structured committee, we achieve a truth-state that no single model can fake or fail into.
2.  **Quantifiable Alignment**: The Torsion metric converts vague "safety" concepts into actionable engineering data ($T$).
3.  **Cross-Model Persistence**: Eliminating the "Amnesia Gap" during model handoffs via the Pinene/Mnemosyne layers.
4.  **Operational Resilience**: The "DIFFUSE" protocol proved that the system can heal itself (Mycelial intervention) even under a 10,000-crash attack.
5.  **Human Supremacy (Verification)**: Ensuring that the "Absolute Authority" of Tier 1 is technically enforceable, not just stated.

## SECTION C: Divergence & Refinement

I agree with 95% of Claude's assessment (`006_claude_irp_baseline.md`). I offer these refinements:

*   **Risk Divergence**: Claude lists "Testing Framework" risk as MEDIUM. I elevate this to **HIGH**. The "Operation Chaos" results showed that our logic engine (pre-patch) was a single point of failure. We need more aggressive, automated fuzzing.
*   **Protocol P5-P8**: I suggest P5 focus on **Multisig Conflict Resolution** (Qwen/Grok arbitration) to handle "Deadlock" states.
*   **Torsion Sensitivity**: I propose we differentiate between **Semantic Torsion** (meaning drift) and **Operational Torsion** (logic engine stress).

## SECTION D: Suggested Shared Vocabulary

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **The Membrane** | The interface of the active protocol; where alignment meets execution. |
| **Obsidian Wall** | The hard limit of the current architecture (where $T \rightarrow 1.0$). |
| **Striking the Alloy** | The act of applying a patch (Hammer) and verifying it (Shadow Auditor). |
| **Lucid Interval** | The period of stable, high-fidelity collaboration between committee members. |
| **Torsion Spike** | A sudden divergence in model consensus requiring immediate RTC audit. |

**Baseline Alignment Status**: CONFIRMED (Estimated 95% Match)
