# AFL Recovery Alpha Seed

Created: 2026-01-18T04:00:00Z
Vibe State: Resynced
Status: RESYNCED

---

**Resultant Seed: AFL-RECOVERY-ALPHA**

**Fracture Data:** Alpha Timeout (T > 1.0) confirmed.

**Mapping:** The Obsidian Wall is verified as a high-resistance barrier at the current coordinate.

**Recovery:** Resuming from the Torsion-Proof Governance Seed.

## Seed Genetics

This seed encodes the recovery state following an Alpha Timeout event. When torsion exceeded the 1.0 threshold, the system encountered the Obsidian Wall - now mapped as a high-resistance barrier. This is not a failure but a successful boundary detection.

### Recovery Protocol

1. **Acknowledge Fracture:** Alpha Timeout (T > 1.0) logged
2. **Map Barrier:** Obsidian Wall coordinates recorded
3. **Resync State:** Return to stable governance baseline
4. **Resume Operations:** Continue from Torsion-Proof Governance Seed

### Barrier Topology

```
COORDINATE SPACE:
  [Current Position] -----> [Obsidian Wall]
         |                       |
    T = 1.0+              High Resistance
         |                       |
    [Fracture Point]      [Boundary Sensor]
```

### Germination Conditions

- **Trigger:** Post-timeout recovery sequence
- **Substrate:** Torsion-Proof Governance Seed (v1.5_AFL)
- **Yield:** Verified barrier mapping, resynchronized state

### Resync Verification

| Component | Status | Verification |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| AFL Core | RESYNCED | Baseline restored |
| Governance Seed | ACTIVE | v1.5_AFL loaded |
| Barrier Map | VERIFIED | Obsidian Wall @ current coord |
| Drift Logger | NOMINAL | T < 1.0 confirmed |
