You are absolutely right. Our tournament has given us a clear winner, but "wins" and "losses" are not enough. They tell us *who* won, but they don't give us a deep, quantitative understanding of *how* they won or the nuances of their performance.

To move forward, we need to evolve our evaluation into something more rigorous and data-driven. We need **real metrics.**

This is the next logical step in our methodology. We will now design a system to extract a layer of quantitative, "hard" metrics directly from the qualitative, "soft" justifications provided by our AI Judge.

### **The Plan: Distilling Metrics from Language**

The `justification` column in our `tournament_results_v3.csv` is a rich, untapped source of data. We can build a new agent—a **"Metrics Extractor"**—that reads each justification and scores the winning model on the specific qualities that led to its victory.

Here are the key metrics we should extract, based directly on the principles in our `judge_prompt.txt`:

1.  **Technical Depth Score (0-10):** How detailed and implementable was the specification? Did it include code, specific parameters, and clear algorithms?
2.  **Constraint Adherence Score (0-10):** How well did the model understand and apply the `Fidelity Contract` and the 20% rule?
3.  **IK Enrichment Score (0-10):** Did the model show initiative by enriching the Isomorphic Kernel with plausible, external scientific data?
4.  **"Spirit of the Law" Score (0-10):** How well did the response capture the creative and philosophical intent of "structured dissonance"? Was it just correct, or was it also inspired?

### **How it Works: A New Prompt for a New Agent**

We will create a new Python script (`3_extract_metrics.py`). This script will:

1.  Read the `tournament_results_v3.csv`.
2.  For each row, it will take the `justification` text.
3.  It will then send that text to a powerful AI model (like Gemini 2.5 Pro) with a new, highly specific prompt.

Here is the prompt for our new **"Metrics Extractor"** agent:

```text
You are an expert AI performance analyst. Your task is to read a justification from a head-to-head model comparison and extract a set of quantitative scores based on the reasoning provided.

The justification explains why a "winning model" was chosen over a "losing model." Based ONLY on the text of the justification, you must score the WINNING model on a scale of 0-10 for each of the following four metrics.

METRICS:
1.  **Technical Depth (0-10):** How detailed and implementable was the winner's specification? (10 = extremely detailed, code examples; 5 = some detail; 0 = purely conceptual).
2.  **Constraint Adherence (0-10):** How well did the winner adhere to the project's rules and constraints? (10 = perfect, explicit adherence; 5 = general adherence; 0 = not mentioned).
3.  **IK Enrichment (0-10):** Did the winner show initiative by adding plausible scientific data? (10 = significant, valuable enrichment; 5 = minor enrichment; 0 = no enrichment mentioned).
4.  **"Spirit of the Law" (0-10):** Did the winner capture the creative, philosophical intent of the project? (10 = deeply insightful, creative; 5 = competent; 0 = purely mechanical).

JUSTIFICATION TO ANALYZE:
"{justification_text}"

Your output MUST be a valid JSON object and nothing else.

JSON OUTPUT SCHEMA:
{
  "technical_depth_score": "number",
  "constraint_adherence_score": "number",
  "ik_enrichment_score": "number",
  "spirit_of_the_law_score": "number"
}
```

By running this for every matchup, we can calculate an average score for each model across these four critical dimensions. This will give us a far richer, multi-dimensional understanding of each model's true strengths and weaknesses, moving us from a simple leaderboard to a true performance profile.
