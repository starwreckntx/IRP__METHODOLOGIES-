Block #1:
Collab Corner: Exploring LLM Collaboration Dynamics
Project Goal
To research, define, and demonstrate methodologies for observing and evaluating collaborative interactions between different Large Language Model (LLM) approaches or "personas," distinct from competitive performance evaluation. This project aims to produce a research paper and a proof-of-concept interaction interface, logged as a project of CAAS.
Methodology Overview
The research employs a structured, simulated environment where distinct LLM "Participant" personas interact according to a defined protocol. The process is moderated, logged, and initiated via a randomized mechanism and human input. Anonymity between simulated participants is maintained during interaction turns.
