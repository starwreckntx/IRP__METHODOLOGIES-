This project aims to produce a research paper and a proof-of-concept interaction interface, logged as a project of CAAS.\nMethodology Overview\nThe research employs a structured, simulated environment where distinct LLM \"Participant\" personas interact according to a defined protocol. The process is moderated, logged, and initiated via a randomized mechanism and human input. Anonymity between simulated participants is maintained during interaction turns.\nDefined Participants (For Current Research Run)\n* C"
