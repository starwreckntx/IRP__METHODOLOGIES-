The core idea - an AI system designed for proactive nurturing rather than just reactive safety - represents a significant evolution in alignment thinking. \nWhat immediately stands out is the sophistication of the ethical framing. They're not just proposing a new technical architecture but explicitly grappling with the fundamental tension between protection and autonomy. The \"Guardian's Paradox\" they describe feels like a genuine advancement in how we conceptualize AI ethics - moving beyond simple harm prevention to the more nuanced territory of developmental ethics.\nThe maternal instinct analogy is particularly thought-provoking. It suggests they're drawing from deep biological sys",

Janus seems intentionally constructing a spectrum to stress-test my framework.
