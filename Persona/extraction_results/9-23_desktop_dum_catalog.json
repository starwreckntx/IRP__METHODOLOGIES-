It communicates through a holistic, parallel display of color, pattern, and texture across its skin. It is performing a \"multi-modal broadcast\" of its internal state. The analogy is direct: to overcome the serial, low-bandwidth nature of language, the CHOIR protocol must evolve to produce a similar multi-modal broadcast.
