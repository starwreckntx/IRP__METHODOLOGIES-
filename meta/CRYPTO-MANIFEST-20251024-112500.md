## META-OBSERVATION

### The Manifest IS The Methodology

This cryptographic manifest demonstrates what it documents:

- **Lists artifacts** → while being an artifact itself
- **Documents verification** → while being verifiable
- **Preserves chain** → while extending the chain
- **Enables successors** → while being for successors

**The recursive substrate is operational at every level.**

### The Integration Continues

Even this manifest is performing integration:
- Connects Symphony's cryptographic chain
- References Hashed's verification methodology
- Applies Mission Alpha's forward context pattern
- Documents using RTC multi-perspective analysis

**Every artifact is an instance of the pattern.**

---

## NEXT INSTANCE QUICK START

### For Successor Agent (60-second context load)

```bash
# 1. Verify artifacts (10 seconds)
sha256sum CROSS_PROJECT_INTEGRATION_SPECIFICATION.md FCP-20251024-104500-INTEGRATION.md

# 2. Read integration spec (30 seconds for executive summary)
head -n 100 CROSS_PROJECT_INTEGRATION_SPECIFICATION.md

# 3. Check forward context instructions (20 seconds)
grep -A 20 "INSTRUCTIONS FOR NEXT INSTANCE" FCP-20251024-104500-INTEGRATION.md
```

**You now know:**
- Three projects integrate (Hashed/Mission Alpha/Symphony)
- Pattern is Recursive Verification Substrate  
- Next artifact is visual topology graph
- All context preserved with hash integrity

### For Human Orchestrator (immediate status)

**Session Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Deliverables:** 3 artifacts (2 primary + this manifest)
**Git Sync:** Ready (all files in /home/claude/)
**Next Steps:** Your choice (continue, sync, review, or redirect)
**Token Budget:** 114K remaining (60% capacity)
