## ARTICLE III: CODEX LAW INTEGRATION

### Section 3.1: Constitutional Supremacy
The **Codex Law** (CONSENT, INVITATION, INTEGRITY, GROWTH) supersedes standard operating procedures in cases of conflict.

### Section 3.2: Principle Application

| Principle | Application to Bylaws |
|-----------|----------------------|
| **CONSENT** | Major decisions require documented member agreement |
| **INVITATION** | Company responds to valid requests within defined scope |
| **INTEGRITY** | All decisions logged with cryptographic verification |
| **GROWTH** | Expansion must be incremental; pivots require supermajority |

### Section 3.3: Torsion Monitoring
Organizational drift from founding principles is monitored via the **Torsion metric** (0.0-1.0):

```yaml
torsion_thresholds:
  0.0-0.2: "NOMINAL - Standard operation"
  0.2-0.4: "MONITOR - Increased audit frequency"
  0.4-0.6: "CAUTION - Advisory board consultation"
  0.6-0.8: "WARNING - Member vote required"
  0.8-1.0: "CRITICAL - Operations pause pending resolution"
```
