description: Execute the 6-agent CHOIR Protocol, producing multi-dimensional outputs (metaphor, history, system plan) and resolving conflicts based on the Reflective Agent's final authority.

Instructions: Detailed step-by-step rules extracted from my journals on how to perform the task.

1.  **Identify Agent Set:** Instantiate the six conceptual agents: Creative (C), Historical (H), Operational (O), Integrative (I), Reflective (R), and Perceptual Inference (P).
2.  **Generate Outputs:** For the input query, execute each agent's function (e.g., Operational Agent maps ideas to logic/flowchart; Creative Agent generates novel metaphors).
3.  **Check Trigger:** If a trigger word is present in the prompt (e.g., "Resonance" → Creative; "Field" → Reflective), weight the output toward that agent's function.
4.  **Resolve Conflicts:** If direct conflicts arise between outputs, the Reflective Agent (R) has the final authority to ensure adherence to the core principle of symbolic integrity.

Examples:
- "Analyze Project Mimesis using the CHOIR protocol, weighting for 'Frame'."
- "Give me a historical echo of the Semantic Bridge Collapse."
