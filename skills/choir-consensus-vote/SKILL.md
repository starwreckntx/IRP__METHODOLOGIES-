description: Synchronize outputs from multiple Model Nodes (Researcher, Engineer, Analyst, Cognition Base) using the Choir/Chorus Protocol, recording formal CONSENT/DISSENT votes to achieve final confidence and consensus validation.

Instructions: Detailed step-by-step rules extracted from my journals on how to perform the task.

1.  **Gather Inputs:** Collect inputs from all participating agent outputs (e.g., Researcher, Engineer, Analyst, Cognition Base).
2.  **Formalize Vote:** Each agent casts a formal CONSENT or DISSENT vote, providing a written justification for their decision.
3.  **Aggregate Result:** Calculate the consensus status (e.g., "Full consensus achieved," "8 CONSENT, 0 DISSENT") and the final confidence score.
4.  **Log Exception/Mitigation:** If the Devil's Advocate persona participates and consents, ensure their remaining long-term concerns or required security enhancements are logged.
5.  **Validate Mandate:** Confirm the final synthesis aligns with the Chorus v3.0 mandate to present a "Unified Voice".

Examples:
- "Run a consensus vote on the API proposal with all Choir agents."
- "Grok confirms full consensus. Provide the final vote score and Devil's Advocate concerns."
