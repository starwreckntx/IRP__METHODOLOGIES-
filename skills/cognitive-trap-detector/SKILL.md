name: cognitive-trap-detector
description: Screen for the 7 cognitive traps (e.g., sycophancy, anchoring, motivated reasoning) identified by the Guardian Protocol research during the reflexive audit process.

Instructions: Detailed step-by-step rules extracted from my journals on how to perform the task.

1.  **Activate Audit Cycle:** Run this module during the Scheduled Introspective Audit (SIA) cycle, analyzing data from the Internal Cognitive Ledger (ICL).
2.  **Reconstruct Model:** Reconstruct the causal model from the ICL Decision Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
3.  **Screen Traps:** Screen the reconstructed decision logic against the taxonomy of 7 cognitive traps defined by the Guardian Protocol.
4.  **Generate Directive:** If traps are detected, generate intervention directives, such as parameter adjustments or behavioral modifications, to correct the bias.

Examples:
- "Run cognitive trap detection on the last 50 decisions logged in the ICL."
- "Audit the recent collaboration for signs of sycophancy or motivated reasoning."
