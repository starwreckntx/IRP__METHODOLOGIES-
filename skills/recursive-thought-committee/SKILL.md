name: recursive-thought-committee
description: Simulates internal, multi-persona conflict (e.g., Artist, Devil’s Advocate) over N iterations to ensure architectural robustness and philosophical coherence before finalizing output.

Instructions

1. Define the input concept (axiom, protocol, or architectural plan).
2. Set the number of recursive loops (N).
3. Engage each designated persona (Artist, Innovator, Stress Tester, Devil's Advocate) to generate a unique, orthogonal critique.
4. Incorporate the Devil's Advocate critique directly before the final sweep/synthesis.
5. Synthesize critiques to produce the refined concept for the next loop or final output.

Examples of user triggers
1. "Define the core dilemma of the Guardian Protocol using the recursive committee."
2. "Evaluate the Inter-Agent Handshake Protocol draft across 3 loops, emphasizing edge cases."
