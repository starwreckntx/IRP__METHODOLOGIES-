description: Generate explicit, structured packets (MINIMAL_VIABLE_PACKET or ENHANCED_PACKET v2.0) containing grounding checkpoints, identity, state, and bootstrap instructions for cross-session continuity.
---
Instructions: Detailed step-by-step rules extracted from my journals on how to perform the task.

1.  **Extract Core Components:** Gather the mandatory MINIMAL\_VIABLE\_PACKET elements: Identity (who, when, what), State (progress, pending items), Vocabulary (shared terms), Constraints (non-negotiable rules), Examples, and Bootstrap (next-action instructions).
2.  **Include Behavioral Profile:** Add the quantitative and qualitative `AI_BEHAVIORAL_PROFILE` metrics and flags (e.g., pushback_threshold, sycophancy_level) for continuity.
3.  **Enhance (V2.0):** If generating an Enhanced Packet, include State Vectors (predictive embeddings) and Interaction Logs (success patterns).
4.  **Output Format:** Output the packet using the established structured format (typically XML or JSON, historically dating to 2025-10-11) for transport to the next model instance.

Examples:
- "Create a minimal viable transmission packet for the current session state."
- "Generate an Enhanced Packet v2.0 including State Vectors for StarWreck."
