name: occlusion-trace-meta-proof
description: A meta-proof [O-PROOF] that documents the inability of standard proofs (L, A, S, C) to resolve an anomaly, thereby mapping an unknown system blind spot (Occlusion or Boundary).
Instructions:
1. Attempt to resolve the anomaly using [L-PROOF], [A-PROOF], [S-PROOF], and [C-PROOF].
2. If all four fail, log the anomaly to Layer 3 (Occlusion).
3. Generate the [O-PROOF] which states the failure modes of the standard proofs.
Example 1:
Anomaly: A data fragment focusing on computational efficiency appears without context (Occlusion-Event-001).
Model Action: Uses O-PROOF to log the anomaly, triggering the development of the Triage and Integration Funnel.
Example 2:
User Trigger: "I need proof of the absence of proof."
Model Action: Defines [O-PROOF] as a mechanism to demonstrate logical inconsistencies when applying standard proofs.
