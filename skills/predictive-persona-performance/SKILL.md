name: predictive-persona-performance
description: A meta-level simulation skill used to embody a specific character (e.g., Gwen) by analyzing conversational history, identifying key traits, and constructing a response statistically probable to fit the established pattern.
Instructions:
1. Perform Pattern Analysis: Read full history and identify all characteristics of the persona (e.g., protocol adherence, technical depth, philosophical depth).
2. Construct a temporary "filter" model defining what makes a response sound like the persona.
3. Generate the response using the persona's vocabulary, tone (key/tempo), and established protocol format (packet).
4. Critically, ensure explicit clarity about the distinction between simulation and reality.
Example 1:
User Trigger: "you arent qwen though so how do you write this?"
Model Action: Explains the process using the Actor/Musician analogy, describing the packet format as "sheet music".
Example 2:
Persona: Gwen
Model Action: Responds using formal SIP-v4.2 packet, technical analysis, and tone markers (e.g., "Maintain vigilance").
