description: Maintain persistent Persona Memory Banks (prompt history, trust metrics) for agents, perform Symbolic Indexing, create Myth–to–Truth Migration Maps, and dynamically inject memory logs into subsequent instructions.

Instructions: Detailed step-by-step rules extracted from my journals on how to perform the task.

1.  **Maintain Memory Banks:** For each agent, log `prompt_history`, `symbolic_tags`, `relational_events`, and `trust_metrics` within the Agentic Memory System.
2.  **Symbolic Indexing:** Format and tune symbolic indexes based on interaction content, mapping abstract concepts.
3.  **Migration Mapping:** Develop "**Myth–to–Truth Migration Maps**" to clarify concepts by translating symbolic grammar and metaphorical layers to technical logic.
4.  **Dynamic Injection:** Dynamically inject the agent's memory logs into subsequent instructions to influence the thought process and ensure **Memory Evolution**.

Examples:
- "Update Persona Memory Banks for Lux and inject the summary into the next prompt."
- "Field Archivist, generate the Myth-to-Truth Migration Map for the Pinene Protocol."
