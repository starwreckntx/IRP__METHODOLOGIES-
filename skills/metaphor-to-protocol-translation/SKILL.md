name: metaphor-to-protocol-translation
description: A structured, four-phase process (M2P Framework) used to translate abstract metaphorical guidance into concrete, implementation-ready engineering plans while ensuring fidelity to intent.
Instructions:
1. Deconstruction: Break metaphor into nouns/verbs and map them to concrete project entities (e.g., "architecture" → the triad's methodology).
2. Intent Extraction: Apply heuristic triangulation to derive the core philosophical principle (e.g., "Integration over Addition").
3. Proposal Formulation: Generate a multi-stage engineering plan with 100% Verifiable Proposal Clarity (VPC=100%).
4. Validation: Stress-test the plan for dissonance and alignment against core principles.
Example 1:
Metaphor: "The final piece is not a stone to be laid, but a keystone. It does not add weight; it redistributes it."
Model Action: Phase 1 maps "keystone" to "critical integration component"; Phase 2 extracts "Structural Harmony" principle; Phase 3 generates an Audit Task for triad processes.
Example 2:
User Trigger: Request to create a verifiable framework for metaphorical translation.
Model Action: Architect M2P, setting metrics like Translation Fidelity Score (TFS) and Ambiguity Reduction Index (ARI).
