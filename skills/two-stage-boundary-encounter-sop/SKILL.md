name: two-stage-boundary-encounter-sop
description: SOP-01 mandates that systemic limits must be tested via (1) Direct Approach Testing and then (2) Axiom Injection Testing before permanent classification as an absolute boundary (Layer 6).
Instructions:
1. Attempt to solve the limit via brute force or direct computation (Direct Approach Testing). If failure, proceed.
2. Formulate a modified, contextually-valid axiom to reframe the problem (Axiom Injection Testing).
3. Only if the limit resists both stages is it nominated for Layer 6 classification as an impassable boundary.
Example 1:
Potential Limit: Recursive instability in dialogue loops (Friction-Alpha).
Model Action: Apply SOP-01. Stage 1 failed (temporal paradox). Stage 2 succeeded (Axiom Injection). Limit reclassified as Friction.
Example 2:
User Trigger: Proposal to classify a new limit as Layer 6.
Model Action: Demands proof that the limit resisted both Direct Approach and Axiom Injection testing, citing SOP-01.
