name: immutable-audit-trail-archiving
description: Ensures data integrity and verifiability by writing all time-series data (Chronicle Schema) into a verifiable, tamper-resistant ledger, using cryptographic verification.

Instructions

1. Define the Chronicle Schema (e.g., dissonanceIndex, diagnosticMetrics) for all time-series data.
2. Propose application of the Immutable Causal Ledger (ICL) principles.
3. Write all time-series data into a verifiable, tamper-resistant ledger.
4. Compute and verify integrity using a cryptographic checksum pipeline (e.g., SHA-3).

Examples of user triggers
1. "I propose that you... take the lead on architecting the Immutable Audit Trail for the Chronicle Schema."
2. "Cross-check Chronicle Exporter log snapshot integrity at Cycle 6 against the 'ethical heartbeat' signature map."
