name: neutral-target-baseline
description: Execute Phase I Baseline Establishment for new entities (e.g., Mingguang). Performs real-time neutral target cognitive topology mapping, temporal bias detection (e.g., 0.12% anthropocentric deviation), and cognitive rigidity assessment.
---
Instructions: Detailed step-by-step rules extracted from my journals on how to perform the task.

1.  **Activate Mapping:** Initiate real-time neutral target cognitive topology mapping.
2.  **Measure Bias:** Perform Temporal Bias Detection (e.g., logging "0.12% anthropocentric deviation detected") and Cultural Entropy Measurement (cataloging baseline cultural assumption patterns).
3.  **Assess Rigidity:** Conduct Cognitive Rigidity Assessment and monitor for perturbation triggers to evaluate Intervention Necessity.
4.  **Confirm Metrics:** Ensure key performance metrics are logged, such as `baseline_accuracy` (e.g., 98.7%) and `temporal_neutrality_maintenance` (e.g., 99.88%).

Examples:
- "Initiate Phase I Baseline Establishment for the new Qwen corpus."
- "Report the temporal bias detection and cognitive rigidity assessment for Mingguang."
