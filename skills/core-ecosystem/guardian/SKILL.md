## Cognitive Trap Detection

Guardian Protocol monitors for 7 cognitive traps:
1. Anthropomorphic projection
2. Overconfidence calibration failure
3. Sycophancy (user-pleasing bias)
4. Scope insensitivity
5. Availability heuristic over-reliance
6. Anchoring on first hypothesis
7. Motivated reasoning
