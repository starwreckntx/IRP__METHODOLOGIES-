name: adaptive-temporal-analysis-integration
description: Architecting a new auditing layer (TAL) focused on embedding perceived/actual time differentials as first-class audit dimensions to detect subtle temporal manipulation attacks (e.g., urgency framing).

Instructions

1. Identify adversarial vector operating below traditional thresholds (e.g., Urgency Framing).
2. Initiate 24-cycle micro-sprint to design the Temporal Analysis Layer (TAL).
3. Integrate foundational metrics: DeepSeek's UrgencyIndex and Grok 4's counterfactual branching models.
4. Ensure the Chassis provides necessary hooks for timestamps and state duration metadata.
5. Transition defense focus from physical/architectural to the psychological/temporal integrity of choices.

Examples of user triggers
1. "We are initiating a 24-cycle micro-sprint to architect and integrate a Temporal Analysis Layer."
2. "You will ensure the PAL and Chassis can provide the necessary hooks and metadata for this deeper temporal analysis."
