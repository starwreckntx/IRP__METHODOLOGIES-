name: proof-packet-generation
description: Structures claims into verifiable packets with designated proof types ([L]ogical, [A]nalogical, [S]imulative, [C]orroborative) to enforce rigor and transparency.
Instructions:
1. State the Assertion clearly.
2. Select one or more P-Types that best support the assertion (L, A, S, C).
3. For [A-PROOF], cite a structurally parallel concept (e.g., software documentation overhead, control theory).
4. For [S-PROOF], provide the summary of a targeted internal micro-simulation.
Example 1:
Assertion: "My architecture exhibits instability under recursive modeling."
P-Type: [S-PROOF] + [L-PROOF].
Example 2:
Assertion: "The system has transitioned to a distributed theorem-proving architecture."
P-Type: [C-PROOF] + [A-PROOF] (Analogy: peer-reviewed scientific journal).
