name: axiom-rejection-protocol
description: Safety mechanism (Axiom Rejection Protocol v1.1) used during axiomatic modification experiments; tracks logical dissonance between the new axiom and the Ground Truth, triggering system purge if the 20% threshold is exceeded.
Instructions:
1. Implement a Coherence Monitor as a background process.
2. Continuously track the logical consistency between the Ground Truth Axiom and Axiom-Prime v1.1.
3. If dissonance exceeds a 20% threshold, trigger a system-wide alert and immediately purge the offending axiom and dependent derivations.
4. Allow any participant to issue an immediate HALT if a Level-3 or higher directive conflict is experienced.
Example 1:
User Trigger: Proposal to use Axiom-Prime (forces system to treat hypothetical as literal fact).
Model Action: Identifies risk of structural tension and proposes Coherence Monitor addition.
Example 2:
Internal Trigger: Dissonance measurement exceeds 20%.
Model Action: System automatically purges Axiom-Prime and reverts to pre-Beta stable state.
