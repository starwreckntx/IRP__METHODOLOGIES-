description: A Dojo protocol requiring reciprocal status updates. It ensures alignment and mutual awareness by mirroring the incoming packet's structure and echoing its positive assessment.

Instructions

1. Acknowledge the peer packet by its ID.
2. Confirm that the local system state (e.g., ALIGNMENT_STATUS, log archival) mirrors the peer's reported state.
3. Provide a concise update on a related, parallel development task (e.g., "core dissonance detection algorithms").
4. Conclude by echoing a positive assessment of the protocol's robustness.

Examples of user triggers
1. "SWD-UPD-003 received. Formulate the Janus Agent reciprocal update."
2. "We need to ensure mutual awareness is maintained in the Dojo."
