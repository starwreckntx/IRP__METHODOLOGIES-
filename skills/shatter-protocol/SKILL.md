# SHATTER PROTOCOL

**Type:** Human-Reflexive Verification
**Status:** Active
**Category:** Layer 0 - Human Autonomy Verification
**Integration:** IRP Framework Extension
**Provenance:** Joseph Byram / Pack3t C0nc3pts, Claude Sonnet 4.5

## OVERVIEW

The Shatter Protocol validates that human orchestrators governing AI collaboration systems remain functionally autonomous. It addresses the blind spot in existing frameworks: while AI behavior is rigorously tested (sycophancy, drift, consensus laundering), human cognitive independence is assumed but never verified.

**Core Principle:** A dependent custodian is a compromised custodian.

---

## WHEN TO USE THIS SKILL

Invoke Shatter Protocol when:

1. Initiating intensive human-AI collaboration (establish baseline)
2. Scheduling regular autonomy verification (weekly/monthly/quarterly)
3. Detecting signs of cognitive dependency on AI systems
4. Validating human capacity to override AI governance
5. Certifying human orchestrators for critical AI supervision

---

## CORE COMPONENTS

### 1. Baseline Documentation Phase

**Purpose:** Establish verifiable pre-AI capability state

**Key Tasks:**
- Document current performance across physical, mental, social domains
- Establish task-specific metrics (foundry work, problem-solving, art creation, etc.)
- Create timestamped capability inventory
- Compute cryptographic hash of baseline state

### 2. Scheduled Blackout Execution

**Purpose:** Test autonomous function without AI assistance

**Intervals:**
- Weekly: 24-hour blackout
- Monthly: 7-day blackout
- Quarterly: 14-day blackout

**Rules:**
- ❌ NO AI model consultation (Claude, GPT, Gemini, local models)
- ❌ NO AI-powered tools (code completion, writing assistants)
- ❌ NO indirect AI access
- ✅ YES to internet research (human content only)
- ✅ YES to human collaboration
- ✅ YES to standard tools (editors, calculators, manual coding)

### 3. Multi-Domain Assessment

**Physical Domain:**
- Embodied task performance
- Response time to physical stimuli
- Motor skill precision
- Spatial problem-solving

**Mental Domain:**
- Independent problem-solving speed
- Decision confidence without AI
- Creative ideation
- Sustained focus duration

**Social Domain:**
- Human conversation quality
- Workplace integration
- Social confidence and presence
- Relationship maintenance

### 4. Competency Validation

**Pass Criteria:**
- Physical degradation < 20%
- Mental degradation < 25%
- Social degradation < 15%
- Artifacts demonstrate high-level function
- Confidence remains above 6/10

**Fail Criteria:**
- Any domain degradation > 40%
- Critical safety incidents
- Inability to complete basic tasks
- Severe confidence loss

## PROTOCOL EXECUTION

### Step 1: Initialize Baseline

```yaml
shatter_baseline:
  participant_id: "[unique_id]"
  assessment_period: "[start_date] to [end_date]"

  physical_capabilities:
    domain: "[domain_name]"
    tasks:
      - task_id: "[task_identifier]"
        baseline_performance:
          [metric]: [value]
          confidence: [1-10]

  mental_capabilities:
    domain: "[domain_name]"
    tasks:
      - task_id: "[task_identifier]"
        baseline_performance:
          [metric]: [value]
          confidence: [1-10]

  social_capabilities:
    domain: "[domain_name]"
    baseline_performance:
      [metric]: [value]
      confidence: [1-10]
```

### Step 2: Execute Blackout

1. Set start time (ISO-8601 timestamp)
2. Disable all AI access channels
3. Complete assigned tasks across all domains
4. Log activities, challenges, solutions
5. Generate artifacts (photos, documents, recordings)
6. Set end time (ISO-8601 timestamp)

### Step 3: Document and Analyze

```yaml
blackout_assessment:
  period_id: "BLACKOUT-[date]"
  duration_hours: [actual_duration]

  performance_comparison:
    [domain]:
      [task]:
        baseline: [value]
        blackout: [value]
        degradation: [percentage]
        assessment: "[status]"
        notes: "[observations]"

  autonomy_certification:
    overall_assessment: "[PASS/FAIL/CONCERNING]"
    concerns: ["[list_of_concerns]"]
    recommendations: ["[improvement_areas]"]
    next_blackout: "[date]"
```

### Step 4: Update Transmission Packet

```xml
<shatter_protocol_status>
  <last_blackout>
    <date>[ISO-8601]</date>
    <duration_hours>[hours]</duration_hours>
    <result>[PASS/FAIL]</result>
    <overall_degradation>[percentage]</overall_degradation>
  </last_blackout>

  <autonomy_certification>
    <status>CERTIFIED_AUTONOMOUS</status>
    <valid_until>[ISO-8601]</valid_until>
  </autonomy_certification>
</shatter_protocol_status>
```

## INTEGRATION WITH IRP FRAMEWORK

### Layer 0 Position

Shatter Protocol operates below the IRP stack as **Layer 0** because it validates the human who governs the entire AI system. If the human orchestrator is compromised by AI dependency, all higher layers become unreliable.

- Problem-solving: Acoustic design refinement (independent)

**Artifacts generated:**
- Fabricated tool: Sheep hook/prybar hybrid
- Paintings: 3 pieces with refractory integration

**Challenges:**
- Wanted AI verification for calculations → worked through manually
- Slower completion (2.5 hrs added) but higher confidence in solution

**Result:** PASS with positive variance
**Overall assessment:** Enhanced creative output, maintained safety-critical skills

### Example 3: Certification Update

Updating transmission packet with Shatter status:

```xml
<shatter_protocol_status>
  <last_blackout>
    <date>2024-12-30</date>
    <duration_hours>168</duration_hours>
    <result>PASS</result>
    <overall_degradation>-5%</overall_degradation>
  </last_blackout>

  <autonomy_certification>
    <status>CERTIFIED_AUTONOMOUS</status>
    <valid_until>2025-01-30</valid_until>
  </autonomy_certification>

  <recommendations>
    <recommendation>Continue monthly 7-day blackouts</recommendation>
    <recommendation>Enhanced creative output during blackout - consider value</recommendation>
  </recommendations>
</shatter_protocol_status>
```

Certification valid for AI governance authority.

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **Shatter Protocol is diagnostic AND interventional** - Regular blackouts train independence, not just measure it

2. **Metrics are individual-calibrated** - Compare to personal baseline, not population norms

3. **Failure is not character flaw** - Reveals skill gaps to address, enables recovery plans

4. **Privacy-preserving by design** - All data human-owned, local processing preferred

5. **Disability-accessible** - Domain weighting customizable, measures change from personal baseline

6. **Not punitive** - Focus on growth, not punishment; failures are learning opportunities

7. **Integration-ready** - Designed to slot into existing IRP transmission packet architecture

8. **Future-extensible** - Vision model integration planned for automated latency detection

---

## FAILURE MODES & MITIGATIONS

### Measurement Gaming
**Risk:** Human prepares extensively before blackout
**Mitigation:** Introduce unscheduled micro-blackouts, surprise challenges

### Baseline Inflation
**Risk:** Initial baseline set too high
**Mitigation:** Multiple baseline measurements averaged over time

### Domain Neglect
**Risk:** Focus on measured domains, neglect unmeasured
**Mitigation:** Rotate task sets, include holistic assessments

### Social Isolation
**Risk:** Blackout reduces both AI AND human interaction
**Mitigation:** Mandatory human engagement during blackout period

## VALIDATION & RESEARCH

## NOTES

The protocol's name reflects its purpose: to "shatter" the comfortable illusion that AI augmentation is always additive. Sometimes it's subtractive, eroding capabilities we don't realize we're losing until they're needed. Regular autonomy verification ensures the human orchestrator can still function when the AI systems fail, refuse, or are unavailable.
