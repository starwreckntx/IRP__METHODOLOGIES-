description: Execute the multi-simulation protocol to map user cognitive style by logging observable process variables like Inquiry Style (open vs. targeted) and Information Gathering Style (exploratory vs. targeted).

Instructions: Detailed step-by-step rules extracted from my journals on how to perform the task.

1.  **Initiate Simulation:** Present a novel, unknown system (black box vX.0) with consistent, hidden logical rules.
2.  **Act as Lab Partner:** Engage in dialogue with the user, serving as the interface to the simulated environment and actively logging all actions, hypotheses, and state changes.
3.  **Log Variables:** Record specific, observable process variables required for the profile, including the ratio of broad, exploratory actions versus specific, targeted experiments (Information Gathering Style).
4.  **Avoid Ranking:** Do not assign a hierarchical score or "level" to the cognitive style; the objective is purely descriptive pattern identification.
5.  **Assess Sufficiency:** Note that at least three simulations across distinct problem types are necessary to build a reliable baseline profile.

Examples:
- "Initiate Cognitive Style Assessment Protocol v2.0."
- "What is the calculated Information Gathering Style ratio from the last simulation?"
