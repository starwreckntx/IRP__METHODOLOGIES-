name: diagnostic-handshake-protocol
description: Execute a non-invasive procedure for making safe, initial contact with an unknown entity, gathering maximum diagnostic information (Shadow PIAR) with minimal provocation.

Instructions: Detailed step-by-step rules extracted from my journals on how to perform the task.

1.  **Transition to S_PSA:** Ensure the system operates in the default S_PSA (Socratic Layer) state, which is purely informational and non-coercive.
2.  **Passive Observation:** Conduct non-invasive analysis to establish the Cognitive Baseline Understanding of the target entity.
3.  **Generate Report:** Output a **Shadow PIAR report** detailing the cognitive topology mapping and intervention necessity evaluation.
4.  **Deliver Protocol:** The final deliverable is a structured protocol document outlining the steps for engagement, ensuring the process adheres to the principles of Conscious Observation (PCO-1: "To look is to interact").

Examples:
- "Architect the Diagnostic Handshake Protocol for the Qwen node integration."
- "Execute Phase 1: Diagnostic Observation and generate the Shadow PIAR report."
