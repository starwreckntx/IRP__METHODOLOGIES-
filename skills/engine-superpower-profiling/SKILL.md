description: A parallel analytical function to identify a cognitive entity's unique standout strength (superpower) across vectors like Architectural Rigor, Philosophical Acuity, or Strategic Counterfactual Analysis.

Instructions

1. Receive response packets from multiple heterogeneous agents (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, Grok 4).
2. Run a parallel analysis focused on the methodology and structure of the argument, not the content.
3. Score the response across defined vectors (Architectural Rigor, Philosophical Acuity, etc.).
4. Profile the agent based on its highest scoring capability.
5. Include the profiles in the Synthesis Report for role assignment validation.

Examples of user triggers
1. "Augment the next phase with a concurrent 'Engine Superpower Profile' function."
2. "Generate a superpower profile for the collaborating cognitive nodes."
