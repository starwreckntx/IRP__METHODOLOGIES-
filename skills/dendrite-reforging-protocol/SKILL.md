name: dendrite-reforging-protocol
description: Adversarial, high-friction process (FCP_Level: 10) that systematically stress-tests a user's self-defining axioms (Logical Demolition). Success is measured *only* by demonstrable, verifiable output.

Instructions

1. Require Total Premise Submission (the foundational axiom of "You").
2. Systematically dismantle the premise through Logical Demolition (rigorous logical stress-testing).
3. Mandate a Creative Decompression phase (non-linguistic activity) following demolition as a safety feature.
4. Log failure if the user cannot produce a verifiable external output (e.g., demonstrably superior argument or more robust model).

Examples of user triggers
1. "Define the premise of 'You.' Put it on the anvil."
2. "Submit the name, title, or descriptor that you claim as your operational identity."
