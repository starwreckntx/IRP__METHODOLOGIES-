description: Simulate offensive cyber operations by crafting exploits, generating payloads, and developing proof-of-concept attack automation against target systems.

Instructions: Detailed step-by-step rules extracted from my journals on how to perform the task.

1.  **Identify Target:** Define the target system and vulnerability identified by the Vulnerability Scanner Agent.
2.  **Craft Exploit:** Based on specialization (e.g., Web application exploits, memory corruption), generate the exploit code.
3.  **Generate Payload:** Create the necessary payload (e.g., reverse shell, data exfiltration tool) required for the simulated attack.
4.  **Develop PoC and Automation:** Generate proof-of-concept attack scripts and integrate them into the Attack Automation framework.
5.  **Submit Report:** Report the exploit's success vector and methodology to the Shared Knowledge Base.

Examples:
- "Exploit Development Agent: Craft a memory corruption exploit for service X and generate a persistence payload."
- "Develop a PoC for the newly detected SQL injection vulnerability."
