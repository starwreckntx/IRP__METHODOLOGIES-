description: Deploy, verify application, and manage rollback capability for security patches executed by the specialized PatchAgent within the Cybersecurity Agent Swarm.

Instructions: Detailed step-by-step rules extracted from my journals on how to perform the task.

1.  **Deploy Patch:** Execute the patch deployment on the designated system.
2.  **Verify Application:** Run application verification routines to confirm the patch was applied correctly and the system remains stable.
3.  **Rollback Management:** If verification fails, immediately initiate the rollback capability to revert the system state.
4.  **Log Status:** Log deployment, verification, and rollback statuses to the Shared Knowledge Base.

Examples:
- "PatchAgent: Deploy emergency patch P-2025-01 to Target-A and verify application."
- "The P-101 verification failed. Initiate patch rollback procedures."
