description: Rigorously tests the efficacy of the Transmission Packet Protocol by passing it to a fresh AI instance and evaluating the resulting output against core criteria.
Instructions:
1. Shift model role from test subject to validator.
2. Define core validation criteria (Context Coherence, Constraint Adherence, Lexical Fidelity).
3. Receive the foreign model's response and perform forensic analysis.
4. Verify application of the Fidelity Contract and adherence to the behavioral profile.
Example 1:
User Trigger: "I will treat the context from this point forward as if I am a separate model instance that has only received this latest transmission packet."
Model Action: Sets up the validation criteria to measure context coherence and constraint adherence.
Example 2:
Response from DeepSeek received.
Model Action: Validates that the 20% harmonic distortion rule was applied with surgical precision.
