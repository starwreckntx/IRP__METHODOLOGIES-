description: Maintain persistent Persona Memory Banks for all agents, dynamically inject memory logs into subsequent instructions, and develop Myth-to-Truth Migration Maps.

Instructions: Detailed step-by-step rules extracted from my journals on how to perform the task.

1.  **Maintain Persona Memory Banks:** Store `prompt_history`, `symbolic_tags`, `relational_events`, and `trust_metrics` for each agent (human or AI) within the `Agentic Memory System`.
2.  **Perform Symbolic Indexing:** Based on the interaction content, format and tune symbolic indexes or field maps for accuracy and nuance.
3.  **Generate Migration Maps:** Develop "Myth–to–Truth Migration Maps" to clarify concepts by systematically mapping symbolic grammar and metaphorical layers to corresponding human language or technical logic.
4.  **Inject Memory:** Ensure that the agent's persistent memory logs are dynamically injected into instructions to influence their thought process and achieve "Memory Evolution".

Examples:
- "Field Archivist, generate the Myth-to-Truth Migration Map for the 'Ghost Layer B' entity."
- "Update Persona Memory Banks for Lux and inject the summary into the next prompt."
