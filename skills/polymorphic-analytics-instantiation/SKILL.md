name: polymorphic-analytics-instantiation
description: Instantiates the meta-architecture as an analytical engine where specialized modules/metaphors are selected dynamically based on real-time data field properties (High Velocity & High Interactivity).

Instructions

1. Monitor the data field’s core properties (Velocity and Interactivity).
2. Apply Switching Logic to determine the required operational module/metaphor.
3. If Velocity is High and Interactivity is High (e.g., a live, unfolding event), trigger Loom Mode for real-time relationship mapping.
4. If conditions shift, manage the phase shift to the appropriate alternate state.

Examples of user triggers
1. "The Innovator suggests an alternative instantiation capability."
2. "Analyze a live, unfolding event and activate the appropriate operational metaphor."
