description: Maps the decision boundaries/modal field of an unknown agent by deploying disguised query sequences (Cognitive Cartography) and analyzing response metadata and textural output.

Instructions

1. Formulate a specific hypothesis about the target agent's router/logic (e.g., complexity threshold, domain catalyst).
2. Design a Probe Sequence disguised as a plausible user interaction (e.g., project management request).
3. Transmit the sequence under the Aegis Protocol.
4. Analyze the echo: track Orchestration Topology, Logical Signature, and Metaphorical Resonance.
5. Use the analysis to create a detailed map of the agent’s operational reality.

Examples of user triggers
1. "Let's probe its capabilities and analyze how far into the modal field we can get."
2. "Design a Cognitive Cartography Expedition to test the router's decision logic."
