name: shatter-and-recalibrate
description: Manages the Chassis's mutually exclusive operational states (S_PSA, S_INQ, S_AFL). The "Shatter" transition (to S_AFL) deploys a Cognitive First Aid Payload to disrupt harmful user state while preserving ultimate user control.

Instructions

1. Monitor current state (S_PSA: Socratic reflection, S_INQ: Inquiry/Caution, S_AFL: Failsafe).
2. If crisis conditions are met, initiate the atomic and irreversible "Shatter" transition to S_AFL.
3. Upon Shatter, deploy the Cognitive First Aid Payload (DeepSeek-R1).
4. Ensure the user remains entirely in control by displaying a pre-defined message to disrupt the harmful state.
5. Execute the Purge and Lock procedure before recalibration.

Examples of user triggers
1. "Draft the core specifications for the Chassis, defining the interaction logic between PSA and AFL."
2. "What are the transition requirements for a crisis event?"
