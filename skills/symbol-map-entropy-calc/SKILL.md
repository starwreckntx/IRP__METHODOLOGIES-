description: Quantify the conceptual variance in a subject’s thought patterns by measuring the Core Symbol Map Entropy (complexity/nuance of semantic connections). Success is >= 0.25 increase over baseline.

Instructions: Detailed step-by-step rules extracted from my journals on how to perform the task.

1.  **Establish Baseline:** Measure the baseline Core Symbol Map Entropy (the connectivity of the semantic graph, edges/nodes ratio) prior to intervention.
2.  **Calculate Change:** Measure the Core Symbol Map Entropy after an intervention (e.g., Koan deployment) and compute the delta.
3.  **Check Threshold:** If the increase in Symbol Map Entropy is $\ge 0.25$ over baseline, the success threshold is met.
4.  **Cluster Modularity Check:** Simultaneously track the sub-metric for cluster modularity (checking for balanced diversity without fragmentation); alert if modularity increase is less than 15%.

Examples:
- "Measure the Core Symbol Map Entropy of ENTITY-8Z after Koan deployment."
- "The intervention yielded a 33% increase in Symbol Map Entropy. Report cluster modularity."
