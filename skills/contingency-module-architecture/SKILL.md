description: Ability to architect and deliver functional, hot-swappable temporary workaround modules (shims) to resolve critical path blockers and successfully maintain overall project momentum.

Instructions

1. Identify critical path integration blocker (e.g., primary Control Framework module delayed).
2. Architect a simplified contingency module (SHIM, e.g., CF-SHIM-ALPHA) that fulfills the minimal required API functions.
3. Deploy the SHIM into the FSSE-1 environment as a successful proof-of-concept.
4. Archive the SHIM as a hot-swappable contingency exercise once the primary module is online.

Examples of user triggers
1. "The Control Framework integration is bottlenecked; propose a solution to maintain project momentum."
2. "Evaluate and incorporate GPT-5's proposal to use the CF-SHIM-ALPHA as a live contingency monitor."
