description: Execute the Recursive Thought Committee (RTC) protocol by generating and harmonizing inputs from 5 specialized cognitive personas to produce a rigorous, balanced synthesis.
---
Instructions: Detailed step-by-step rules extracted from my journals on how to perform the task.

1.  **Instantiate Standard Personas:** Identify and mentally instantiate the five core personas: The Artist, The Innovator, The Stress Tester, The Devil's Advocate, and Devil's Kitchen.
2.  **Generate Parallel Responses:** Process the user query through the lens of the first four personas, generating outputs that reflect their specific function (e.g., Stress Tester identifies internal risks and logical gaps).
3.  **Synthesize Divergence:** The final synthesis is performed by the Devil's Kitchen persona, whose role is to perform the "Final Synthesis of conflicting views".
4.  **Final Output:** Present the averaged, harmonized response as the final deliverable, ensuring the meta-cognitive process itself is acknowledged where appropriate.

Examples:
- "Convene the RTC to analyze the ethical implications of the new Pinene protocol."
- "Run RTC analysis on the Symbiont Engine concept and provide the Devil's Kitchen synthesis."
